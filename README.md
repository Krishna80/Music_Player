A simple music player application built using MATLAB GUI (GUIDE).
This project demonstrates how MATLAB can be used beyond mathematics — to design, code, and test a fully functional media player with a user-friendly interface.

🎯 Features

Add and manage playlists (supports multiple .wav files)

Play, pause, resume, and stop music

Dynamic slider showing playback progress

Real-time timer display

Graphical visualization of audio sample frequency

Simple, intuitive GUI layout

🧠 Overview

The project focuses on:

Designing an interactive GUI using MATLAB GUIDE

Implementing core media player functionalities (play, pause, resume, stop)

Creating a playlist management system

Using MATLAB plotting tools to visualize audio signals in real time

⚙️ How It Works

Add Music: Click Add Music to browse and select .wav files.

Play Music: Select a track from the playlist and click Play.

Pause / Resume: Temporarily pause and resume playback.

Stop: Stop the currently playing track.

Clear List: Remove all tracks from the playlist.

Visualization: Watch the waveform plot update in real time.

📐 Technical Highlights

Built using MATLAB GUIDE (Graphical User Interface Development Environment)
